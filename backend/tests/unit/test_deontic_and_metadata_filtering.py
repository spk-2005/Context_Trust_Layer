Tests for Deontic Modality Classification and Table Metadata Segregation.
Ensures that:
1. Revision history tables are routed to metadata/provenance, NOT emitted as policy claims.
2. Table of contents / section tables are routed to outline metadata, NOT emitted as policy claims.
3. Sign-off / approver tables are routed to authority records, NOT emitted as policy claims.
4. Purely descriptive guidance (e.g. 'The primary goal is...') is filtered out.
5. Table matrix claims and normative obligations/prohibitions are extracted with clean S-P-O and explicit deontic modalities.

## Policy Summary
Deductions from Full & Final Salary may include laptop and asset values, loan adjustments, taxes, WFH allowance recovery, excess leaves, short notice periods, joining bonus recovery, and EPF/VPF deductions.

## 3.2 Points to Remember
Employees must return all Wingify property upon offboarding.
Shipping costs will be covered by Wingify through a mutually agreed-upon method.

## 3.3 Deduction from Full & Final Salary
If the employee retains the laptop and other company assets, their value will be deducted from the Full and Final Salary as per the Asset Management Policy.
Any outstanding loans or advances the employee takes will be fully adjusted from their Full and Final Salary.
If investment proofs, as declared on the HR Portal, are not provided during exit, taxes will be deducted accordingly.
WFH Allowance will be recovered based on the Home Office Allowance Policy if the exit is within a year of joining.
Recovery will be made for any excess leaves taken beyond the allotted quota.
If the employee does not serve the full notice period, the company holds the right to recover the amount equivalent to the short notice period.
Joining Bonus recovery will be as per the terms mentioned in the offer letter.
EPF (Employee Provident Fund) and VPF (Voluntary Provident Fund) deductions will be made and deposited into the employee's account.
