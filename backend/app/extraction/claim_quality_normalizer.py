Sprint AF: Claim Quality Normalizer
Transforms raw extracted contract claims into clean, atomic, deduplicated, and agent-usable policy claims.

Implements the 7-phase quality pipeline:
1. Split non-atomic claims (one claim = one subject + one predicate + one object + optional conditions)
2. Normalize bad subjects & enforce subject allowlist
3. Enforce a central controlled predicate vocabulary
4. Deduplicate claims by normalized semantic signature
5. Reclassify non-rules (separate descriptions, definitions, references, and examples)
6. Context-aware conflict evaluation (no false conflicts on complementary rights)
7. Re-review and recover falsely rejected contractual rules
